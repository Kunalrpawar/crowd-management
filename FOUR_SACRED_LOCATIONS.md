## 📖 The Legend: Samudra Manthan

According to Hindu mythology:

1. **The Churning:** Gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) churned the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthan) to obtain the nectar of immortality (amrita).

2. **The Battle:** When the pot (kumbh) containing the nectar emerged, a battle ensued for 12 divine days (equivalent to 12 human years).

3. **Four Drops:** During the battle, four drops of nectar fell at four locations on Earth:
   - Prayagraj (Allahabad)
   - Haridwar
   - Nashik
   - Ujjain

4. **Sacred Significance:** These locations became sacred, and bathing in the rivers during Kumbh Mela is believed to cleanse sins and grant moksha (liberation).
